    "\n",
    "This is the template for for the first Python assignment given in the course SC3011TN. In this exercise, we will analyze and simulate the one-dimensional dynamics of a black hole, to determine if the process is wide sense stationary (WSS). Use this template to answer the questions. \n",

    "### How to use the template\n",
    "As you will see there are two types of cells in this Jupyter Notebook, **Python** cells indicated with `In [ ]:` and **Markdown** cells that have no marking to the left of the cell. For the **Markdown** cells you have to click on the text itself (indicated throughout the text with 'Click here to type your answer').\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **Python** work in the usual way, enter your code and press `Shift Enter` to run the cell, the output will be displayed below the cell. Variables and functions will be accessible by the other cells after you have run the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **Markdown** cells use the **Markdown** type setting language. This is a very simple type setting system. Check the [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for a over view of the commends. Furthermore, **Markdown** works with **LaTeX** math, `$ $` for inline equations and `$$ $$` for centered equations. Press `Shift Enter` to compile the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have answered the questions and are finished with the assignment, you can export the **Jupyter Notebook** as a PDF. Go to the top left, click on `File` then `Download As` and Choose **PDF**. If this feature is not supported by your system, you can also choose **LaTeX**. Then you Download a **LaTeX** project. You can then use your preferred **LaTeX** compiler to create the **PDF**.   \n",

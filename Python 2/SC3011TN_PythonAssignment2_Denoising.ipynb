    "## Python Template\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the template for for the second Python assignment given in the course SC3011TN. In this exercise, we will use a FIR Wiener filter to denoise signals, which were obtained by sending and recording with Arduino microcontrollers. Due to the COVID-measures, we can sadly not allow you to record signals yourself, so this year we have recorded signals for you and you are tasked solely with filtering the signals. Use this template to answer the questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use the template\n",
    "As you will see there are two types of cells in this Jupyter Notebook, **Python** cells indicated with `In [ ]:` and **Markdown** cells that have no marking to the left of the cell. For the **Markdown** cells you have to click on the text itself (indicated throughout the text with 'Click here to type your answer').\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **Python** cells work in the usual way, enter your code and press `Shift Enter` to run the cell, the output will be displayed below the cell. Variables and functions will be accessible by the other cells after you have run the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **Markdown** cells use the **Markdown** type setting language. This is a very simple type setting system. Check the [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for a overview of the comments. Furthermore, **Markdown** works with **LaTeX** math, `$ $` for inline equations and `$$ $$` for centered equations. Press `Shift Enter` to compile the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have answered the questions and are finished with the assignment, you can export the **Jupyter Notebook** as a PDF. Go to the top left, click on `File` then `Download As` and Choose **PDF**. If this feature is not supported by your system, you can also choose **LaTeX**. Then you Download a **LaTeX** project. You can then use your preferred **LaTeX** compiler to create the **PDF**.   \n",

As the COVID-measures prevent us from letting you record your own signals, we have done the experiment for you and we provide you with the raw recordings. Before doing so, we describe the experimental setup that we used to record the signals. The experimental setup is shown in the figure below. \n",

    "For this experiment, two Arduino MK1000's are used. These Arduino microcontrollers are able to send and receive signals through radio frequency (RF) wireless transmission. As such, the first microcontroller is configured as a sender, used to send a wav-file `gong.wav`. The second microcontroller is configured as a receiver and it is linked to the sender. By simultaneously activating both microcontrollers, the receiver will record the signal sent by the sender.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the signal transmission is affected by RF noise. Examples of sources of this noise are disturbances in the RF band, distance-dependent noise caused by the distance between the microcontrollers and thermal distortion of the signal. These noise sources act additively on the sent signal `gong.wav`. For distances of 5 cm, 100 cm and 250 cm between the microcontrollers, we recorded `gong_5cm.mat`, `gong_100cm.mat` and `gong_250cm.mat` respectively, which you can listen to later in this assignment.\n",

    "distance-independent noise. This noise is assumed to be zero-mean and white, and a measurement of this noise is contained in `noise.mat`.\n",
